    "# Data Governance\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS calls this knowledge domain Data Security, but a better title would be Data Governance.  Security is one aspect of Governance and the exam does tend to focus on security quite a bit, but you will also encouter questions regarding other aspects of Data Governance.\n",
    "\n",
    "[\"Data Governance is the discipline which provides all data management practices with the necessary foundation, strategy, and structure needed to ensure that data is managed as an asset and transformed into meaningful information.\"](http://www.lightsondata.com/what-is-data-governance/)\n",
    "\n",
    "I like this definition becuase it clearly defines data as an asset.  Just like any other asset like property, vehicles, or livestock data has a value and therefore must be treated as valuable.  The need for secuirty is obvious if you think of data as an asset.  Just like you want to control who can enter your building and what they can do when they get there.\n",
    "\n",
    "But notice the second part of that sentence: 'Transformed into meaningful information'.  What does that mean?  Think of the data as a raw material like bauxite.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is bauxite?  Bauxite is a mineral ore that contains aluminum and other metals.  It's the main source of the worlds aluminum supply and is found in many places throughout the world.  Bauxite must undergo several complex processes requiring chemistry and a large amount of electric power before it can become aluminum.  Even then, aluminum is a \"raw\" material that needs to be made into the products we use.  This complex set of processes is similar to Data Governance.  Data Govenance is the set of processes that allow us to transform our raw data into finished information products."

    "The AWS platform offers solutions for encypting data in transit and at rest.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Data in transit is typically protected with Transport Layer Security or it's predecessor Secure Socket Layer.  Data may also be protected in transit by using client side side encryption where data is encrypted BEFORE it traverses the network in a separate step.\n",
    "\n",
    "TLS and SSL use x.509 certificates to exchange keys for encrpytion with the public key used to encrypt data and the private key used for decryption.  All connections to the AWS APIs use TLS encrypted with certiticates signe by a public certificate authority.  For example, all data transfer to S3 is encrypted in transit.  You do not need to configure anything and it's not possible to disable it.  To secure network traffic to your OWN services AWS can issue certificates to your domain with the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).  ACM typically isn't covered on the Big Data exam, but you should be aware that data into AWS is encrypted with TLS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many AWS storage and database services have several options for encrypting data at rest.  The right option depends on the requiremnents presented and any regulatory compliance needed.  We'll cover encryption options in the sections for various services, but there are a few underlying technologies you should understand first.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cloud HSM\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud HSM helps you meet corporate, contractual and regulatory compliance requirements for data security by using dedicated Hardware Security Module (HSM) instances within the AWS cloud. AWS offers a variety of solutions for protecting sensitive data within the AWS platform, but for some applications and data subject to contractual or regulatory mandates for managing keys, additional protection may be necessary. CloudHSM complements existing data protection solutions and allows you to protect your encryption keys within HSMs that are designed and validated to government standards for secure key management. CloudHSM allows you to securely generate, store and manage cryptographic keys used for data encryption in a way that keys are accessible only by you.\n",

    "AWS IAM Roles are conceptually similar to Users: You can assign permission policies to a Role just like you can a user or group.  However, instead of being associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it.  A role does not have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roles have a number of use cases in AWS:\n",
    "\n",
    "Delegation is used to assign permission to an IAM account that they wouldn't otherwise have.  This is commonly used to grant access to a user from another AWS account.  This is typical when there is a hierarchy of AWS accounts in an Organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Federation allows trust relationships to be formed with external account providers such as GSuite or Active Directory.  Users defined in external account providers may be assigned to one or more Roles and granted access to AWS resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the AWS Big Data Exam you probably don't need to know much about Delegation or Federation.  These use cases tend to be covered by the Architect or DevOps exams.  Service and Service Linked Roles on the other hand must be understood to properly configure many of the Big Data services.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "From the AWS documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A Service Roles is role that a service assumes to perform actions in your account on your behalf. When you set up some AWS service environments, you must define a role for the service to assume. This service role must include all the permissions required for the service to access the AWS resources that it needs. Service roles vary from service to service, but many allow you to choose your permissions, as long as you meet the documented requirements for that service. Service roles provide access only within your account and cannot be used to grant access to services in other accounts. You can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So, a Service Role is simply a role that is assumed by an AWS service on your behalf.  You are responsible for creating the role and configuring the permissions.  The role must exist before the AWS service can be configured to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Service-Linked Role is an evolution of the Service Role.  From the AWS docs:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A unique type of service role that is linked directly to an AWS service. Service-linked roles are predefined by the service and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf. The linked service also defines how you create, modify, and delete a service-linked role. A service might automatically create or delete the role. It might allow you to create, modify, or delete the role as part of a wizard or process in the service. Or it might require that you use IAM to create or delete the role. Regardless of the method, service-linked roles make setting up a service easier because you don’t have to manually add the necessary permissions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Big Data services use a mix of Service Role and Service-Linked Roles in their respective configurations.  The Big Data exam doesn't ask directly about which services use Service-Linked Roles, but it does ofter ask detailed questions about configuring roles for these services, so it's important to know the requirements for setting up each.  We cover a few of these in detail in the next part of this lesson."
